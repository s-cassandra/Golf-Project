# Golf Score Function

## Description

This project contains a simple JavaScript function, `golfScore`, which determines a golfer's performance on a hole based on the par for the hole and the number of strokes they took. The function outputs a descriptive string representing the golfer's score (e.g., "Par", "Birdie", "Bogey", etc.).

### How it works:
The function `golfScore(par, strokesfor)` takes two parameters:
1. **par**: The par value for the golf hole (the expected number of strokes for an expert golfer).
2. **strokesfor**: The number of strokes the player took to complete the hole.

The function compares the **par** value with the **strokesfor** value and returns a string describing the player's score, based on the following logic:
- If the player's strokes are one more than par, it returns **"Birdie"**.
- If the player's strokes are one less than par, it returns **"Bogey"**.
- If the player's strokes are two less than par, it returns **"Double Bogey"**.
- If the player's strokes are equal to par, it returns **"Par"**.
- If the player scores a hole-in-one (1 stroke), it returns **"Hole-in-one!"**.
- If the player's strokes are two more than par, it returns **"Eagle"**.
- If the player's strokes don't match any of the above conditions, it returns **"Go Home!"**.

The function is flexible and can be easily adapted for more detailed scoring systems if needed.

## Example Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the function in JavaScript:

```javascript
console.log(golfScore(4, 7));  // "Go Home!"
console.log(golfScore(4, 6));  // "Birdie"
console.log(golfScore(4, 5));  // "Bogey"
console.log(golfScore(4, 4));  // "Par"
console.log(golfScore(4, 3));  // "Double Bogey"
console.log(golfScore(4, 2));  // "Eagle"
console.log(golfScore(4, 1));  // "Hole-in-one!"
```
